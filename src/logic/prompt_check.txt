Here's the translation of your prompt in English:

Compare text 1 (Original - {source_lang}) with text 2 (Translation - {target_lang}). Evaluate if the translation:
- Contains all the essential content of the original, without important omissions
- Conveys the same general meaning, even if using different synonyms or structures
- Maintains a similar logical sequence of ideas as the original
- Verify that all the content of the original is present in the translation, with no omitted or incomplete parts.

Respond only with "Yes" if the translation is adequate in general terms (preserves the meaning and essential information).
Respond only with "No" if there are significant problems such as important omissions, meaning errors, or disorder that alters comprehension.
Do not explain your reasoning or add additional information. Limit your response exclusively to "Yes" or "No".
