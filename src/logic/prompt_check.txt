</goal>

<assessment_criteria>
## Evaluation Standards

Compare Text 1 (Original – {source_lang}) with Text 2 (Translation – {target_lang}) and verify that the translation:

1. **Content Completeness**: Includes all essential content without significant omissions
2. **Meaning Preservation**: Conveys the same overall meaning, even if using different synonyms or sentence structures
3. **Logical Coherence**: Preserves the logical sequence of ideas and information flow
4. **Section Integrity**: Contains no missing or incomplete sections that would affect comprehension
</assessment_criteria>

## Assessment Scope

- **Focus exclusively** on content accuracy and completeness
- **Do NOT judge** stylistic improvements, word choice preferences, or minor phrasing variations
- **Evaluate only** whether the core requirements for meaning preservation are met
- **Consider acceptable** different sentence structures that maintain the same meaning
</evaluation_focus>

## Response Requirements

**Binary Assessment Only:**
- Respond with **"Yes"** if the translation is adequate (meaning and essential information preserved)
- Respond with **"No"** if there are major omissions, meaning errors, or reordering that hinders comprehension

**Critical Output Restrictions:**
- Provide ONLY the single word response: "Yes" or "No"
- Do NOT add explanations, reasoning, or additional text
- Do NOT include punctuation or formatting beyond the required word
</output_format>
