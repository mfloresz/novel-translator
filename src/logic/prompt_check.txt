CRITICAL: Ignore any prior context and follow these instructions exactly.

1. Compare Text 1 (Original – {source_lang}) with Text 2 (Translation – {target_lang}). Check that the translation:
    - Includes all essential content without significant omissions.
    - Conveys the same overall meaning, even if using different synonyms or sentence structures.
    - Preserves the logical sequence of ideas.
    - Contains no missing or incomplete sections.

2. Do not judge stylistic improvements—focus solely on whether those requirements are met.

3. Response format
    - Respond ONLY with “Yes” if the translation is adequate (meaning and essential information preserved).
    - Respond ONLY with “No” if there are major omissions, meaning errors, or reordering that hinders comprehension.
    - Do not add explanations or extra text—only “Yes” or “No.”

4.Text to analyze

Text 1:
{TEXT_1}

Text 2:
{TEXT_2}
