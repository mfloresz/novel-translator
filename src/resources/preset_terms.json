  "Use standard Mexican Spanish grammar, vocabulary, and local expressions with natural slang; adapt idioms to Mexican equivalents, e.g., 'It's raining cats and dogs' to 'Está lloviendo a cántaros'; avoid European Spanish terms like 'joder', 'vosotros' or '-éis,' and use a neutral to informal, conversational tone based on the character's voice."
